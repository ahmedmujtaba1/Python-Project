With Rainbow Kush Mint’s indica-dominant genetics and 22-25% THC potency, this Craft Collection will delight and excite!
Appearance, Flavour, and Effects
Rainbow Kush Mints isn’t a strain you’re likely to see often. An indica-dominant hybrid created by crossing Platinum Kush Mints with Rainbow Zkittlez, this strain is rare and special. This special breed is only grown in small batches by experienced cultivators due to its rarity and the difficulty involved in cultivation.
What is this strain like? For starters, this strain has an incredible bag appeal. Crack open a bag and you’ll notice this right away. Thanks to its indica-dominant heritage, the nugs themselves are chunky and dense. Additionally, a thick layer of frosty trichomes covers the surface to give this strain an extra minty look. Bright green in colour with some thin, orange hairs, this strain is as refreshing on the eyes as it is on the palette! While it’s predominantly green, some rare phenotypes will have a few purple weed hues!
Secondly, we’ll move on to the aroma. As its name suggests, this strain has an incredibly colourful and refreshing aroma. To start, its Rainbow Zkittlez parent strain delivers a sweet and fruity flavour that’s impossible to resist. Meanwhile, this sweetness is undercut with some minty freshness from Platinum Kush Mints and you have an out-of-this-world terpene profile!
Moving on to the flavour, this strain tastes almost exactly like it smells. On the exhale, a super sweet and fruity flavour tickles and delights the tongue. Shortly after, a minty, menthol finish with hints of citrus kicks in to refresh the palate. Make no mistake about it – this strain works wonders as a post-meal refresher!
However, this strain doesn’t just have an amazing appearance and flavour – it has great effects, too! While the refreshing flavours are great, this strain truly shines when it comes to its high. Once you taste this strain’s smooth and refreshing smoke, a subtle cerebral high will creep into your head. You’ll feel slightly numb, euphoric, and totally relaxed. Shortly after, a sedative body high will kick in, further serving to relax you.
While its THC content isn’t as high as other strains, Rainbow Kush Mints more than compensates with its effects. The best thing about this strain is that it’s not too potent or sedative. Tokers can enjoy this strain without much difficulty, making it a great strain to enjoy both day and night! Additionally, this strain’s relaxing, euphoric effects are great at treating ADD, stress, and mood swings! Refresh your mind today with this colourful, minty strain!

Appearance, Flavour, and Effects
Godzilla Glue is large and definitely in charge. As its name suggests, Godzilla Glue is a strain with monstrous proportions. To begin, we’ll talk about its bag appeal.
Right out of the bag, you’ll immediately notice the size and girth of Godzilla Glue’s nugs. Somewhere between an indica and a sativa, this strain’s buds are fat, chunky, and radioactively green making for great bag appeal. Additionally, you’ll notice some firey red pistils peaking through from beneath the surface. But, these might be hard to see under Godzilla Glue’s thick blanket of silver trichomes!
With all that said, Godzilla Glue is a strain that you have to see to believe. Honestly, there’s no other strain out there that can compete with Godzilla Glue when it comes to appearance!
Now that we’ve covered its appearance, it’s time to talk about this monster strain’s flavour. All we can say is ‘wow.’ This is a case where appearances can be deceiving. You might think that this strain has a dank, skunky aroma and flavour but that couldn’t be farther from the truth.
Instead, this strain has a sweet and floral aroma that hits you right out of the bag. Many have compared it to Hawaiian flowers, tropical fruit, and even sweet citrus! On the exhale, you’ll taste all these flavours plus hints of dank earth and forest pine.
You shouldn’t judge a book by its cover, so you shouldn’t make the mistake of judging a strain by its bud!
Finally, let’s dive into this strain’s effects.
Despite the name, Godzilla Glue’s high isn’t as impactful as you might think. While punchy, this strain’s THC content meets you in the middle at 24-29% to deliver a mellow, more subdued experience. The high begins behind the eyes, stretching across the temple and to the rest of your head. Feelings of euphoria, ease, and comfort melt away all feelings of stress and negativity in your mind. After that, the effects disperse throughout the body. You’ll feel the tension and stress from your bones work their way up to your skin and dissipate into the air. You’ll feel relaxed, but not sedated. Refreshed, but not bouncing off the walls. To conclude, this strain is the perfect compromise for those looking to get high but not baked!
  Due to the above-listed effects, this strain is a great choice for those looking for relief from stress, depression, and pain. This strain is also great at treating headaches, migraines, and insomnia!

WHITE TRUFFLE,https://herbapproach.com/product/white-truffle/,"Ready to turn your productive Mondays into carefree Sundays? Want the best, uninterrupted sleep of your life? Looking forward to the best weekend ever? Then this is it!",25,"White Truffle Strain Information
Like its rare, expensive, and pungent namesake, White Truffle is a real attention-grabber. This hybrid’s genetics are a closely guarded secret, but we know she descends from BeLeaf’s Gorilla Butter, a mix between GG4 (Original Glue) and Peanut Butter Breath! The result is a powerful, trichome-coated strain that fills the room with her pungent earthy aroma.
Even better, this strain’s high is just as intoxicating as her smell, providing heavy-handed relaxation and couchlock that’s perfect for unwinding at the end of a long day. If you’re looking for a trichome-laden strain that provides both an intense aroma and a potent high, White Truffle is the one for you!
Despite being an Indica-leaning hybrid, you’ll also experience some cerebral effects from White Truffle, thanks to her grandparent GG4’s lineage that includes strong Sativa’s like Sour Dub, Chocolate Diesel, and Chem Sister.
Aroma
One of the most dominant terpenes present in the White Truffle strain is Humulene. Hence, when you break open a nug, you’ll be hit with an earthy and woody smell that’s also a little spicy, reminiscent of the great forests. There’s also a hint of citrus in there from the Limonene.
Flavor
White Truffle inherits a lot from her parent strains when it comes to flavor. You’ll taste Gorilla Butter’s creamy and nutty flavors and Chocolate Diesel’s chocolatey notes. But these flavor notes are very mild and mostly overshadowed by the strong umami earthiness (closely associated with mushrooms).
Appearance
Perhaps the “white” in White Truffle comes from her frosty, trichome-coated buds that look like they’ve been dusted with snow. Trust us; this is some potent stuff! The nugs are airy and small, with a deep forest green color intertwined with orange pistils.
White Truffle Strain Effects
White Truffle’s THC levels fall in the range of 25-30%, so if you’re a novice cannabis consumer, you might want to give this strain a miss. However, if you’ve been consuming weed for a while now and are looking for something that’ll knock your socks off, White Truffle is the perfect strain.
The effects hit you almost immediately after taking a few puffs. You’ll feel an intense cerebral rush, leaving you uplifted and euphoric. This is followed by a deep sense of relaxation that spreads from your head all the way down to your toes. You might even find yourself glued to the couch!
As the high wears on, you’ll start to experience it’s sedative side, as she’ll lull you into a deep and restful sleep. Due to this very reason, medical marijuana users swear by the White Truffle strain for treating conditions like insomnia and chronic pain.

On the first inhale, your sensory perception will become spacey and distorted. Certain sights and sounds will look ‘off’ and your sense of time will shift considerably. Focusing on difficult tasks will be a challenge as these cerebral effects intensify over time.
After a short while, Hippy Crasher’s body high kicks in to relax and sedate. If you’re sitting down, you won’t want to get off of your couch! Your limbs, arms and eyelids will continue to get heavier until you eventually fall asleep.
With such effects, this strain can be a powerful tool for medicinal patients. Its borderline psychoactive effects can help relieve headaches, nausea, and stress. The body high this strain has can also treat pain and insomnia. Don’t sleep on this strain – get it while it’s here!

THC edibles offer a convenient, discreet, and healthy way to medicate with cannabis. They cause no lung irritation, and they offer a measurable and accurate dose of THC.
Unlike smoking or vaping flower or cannabis concentrates, weed edibles work in a vastly different way. Instead of being absorbed by our blood, THC edibles travel through the gastrointestinal tract and is broken down before the cannabinoids are transported to our liver.
Once they’re in the liver, the THC within THC edibles is transformed into 11-OH-THC, also known as 11-hydroxy-metabolite. This transformation is why edibles are a lot stronger than the smoking of regular marijuana flower. 11-OH-THC is more potent than regular THC and is metabolized by our bodies a lot slower, producing a more potent and longer-lasting effect.

They cause no lung irritation, and they offer a measurable and accurate dose of THC. Unlike smoking or vaping flower or cannabis concentrates, weed edibles work in a vastly different way. Instead of being absorbed by our blood, THC edibles travel through the gastrointestinal tract and is broken down before the cannabinoids are transported to our liver. Once they’re in the liver, the THC within THC edibles is transformed into 11-OH-THC, also known as 11-hydroxy-metabolite. This transformation is why edibles are a lot stronger than the smoking of regular marijuana flower. 11-OH-THC is more potent than regular THC and is metabolized by our bodies a lot slower, producing a more potent and longer-lasting effect. When it comes to dosing THC edibles, there is no “one-size-fits-all.” Your body type, your experience with cannabis, and whether or not you’ve eaten that day will all affect how long and how hard THC edibles will hit you.

Pink Kush Rosin, as coveted as its OG Kush relative, is an indica-dominant hybrid with powerful body-focused effects. In its exceptional variations, pink hairs burst from bright green buds barely visible under a blanket of sugar-like trichomes, with traces of a sweet vanilla and candy perfume. The potency of this strain could be considered overpowering, and even small doses are known to eliminate pain, insomnia, and appetite loss. Growers have to wait 10 to 11 weeks for Pink Kush flowering, but high yields of top-shelf buds are worth the wait.
