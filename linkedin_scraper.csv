Project Description
Project : Identifying novel drug-disease associations using a global network of biomedical relationships.
Drug repositioning is the process of identifying novel therapeutic potentials for existing drugs and discovering therapies for untreated diseases. Since drug repositioning relies on data for existing drugs and disease, the enormous growth of publicly available large-scale biological, biomedical and electronic health-related data along with MI/AI have accelerated the development of computational drug repositioning approaches. Biomedical communities have performed and analyzed various types of high-throughput experiments to understand physiological, biochemical and genetic relationships in the human body system. Furthermore, over 20 millions of biomedical research articles have been examined for the understanding of how chemicals, genes and physiological phenotypes interact with each other using Natural Language Processing techniques. However, regardless of these efforts, integrating multiple biochemical relationships and text mining information for drug repositioning is still a major challenge.
Klick will develop a new method to find novel repositioning drugs by integrating heterogeneous biomedical networks and text mining. To do this, network propagation, graph neural networks or other ML/DL algorithms will be applied to find novel associations between diseases and existing drugs. Klick collected various drug-related data, such as chemical properties, therapeutic characteristics, targets and physiological effects of approved drugs as well as over 20 years of accumulation of drug-related research articles. Intern will extract biomedical relationships from Klick’s drug datalake, and build a predictive model to find novel drug-disease interactions.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement  change  in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only  about  hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and  world  changing? Be you, with us!

Senior Data Scientist,"Etobicoke, Ontario, Canada",Myant Inc.,"About Us:

At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.

The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.

Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.

The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.

We are a multi-disciplinary technology team solving big challenges at the intersection of fashion, electronics, software, and data science.

Responsibilities:

Develop Signal Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms for extracting information and clinically valuable metrics from bio-signals including ECG, EMG, activity, Temperature, PPG, EEG for continuous long-term monitoring;

Design protocols, methods and ethics applications for clinical data collection
Transfer codes and documentation to the Product team for implementation in Myant products
Collaborate with academic and industrial partners for validation of Myant Products
Take ownership of all your deliverables and communicate your results for timely project delivery
Working in an ISO-13485 and HIPAA regulated environment, following quality procedures for design and development as well as verification and validation for clinical use, including to support regulatory approval.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement  change  in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong!) and only  about  hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and  world  changing? Be you, with us!

"Machine Learning Engineer, Tool Use",Canada,Cohere,"Who are we?

We’re a small, diverse team working at the cutting edge of machine learning. At Cohere, our mission is to build machines that understand the world and to make them safely accessible to all. Language is at the crux of this, but it can be difficult and expensive to parse the syntax, semantics, and context that all work together to give words meaning. The Cohere platform provides access to Large Language Models through its APIs that read billions of web pages and learn to understand the meaning, sentiment, and intent of the words we use in a richness never seen before.

We recently raised our Series B , signed a multi-year partnership with Google Cloud , and we are focused on bringing our technology to market. We will partner with customers so they can build natural language understanding and generation into their products with just a few lines of code.

We’re ambitious — we believe our technology will fundamentally transform how industries interact with natural language. And we have the technical chops to back it up - Cohere’s CEO, Aidan Gomez, is a co-author of the groundbreaking paper “Attention is all you need” , (over 53k citations) and was previously part of Google Brain. Our entire technical team is world-class.

We are focused on creating a diverse and inclusive work environment so that all of our team members can thrive. We welcome kind and brilliant people to our team, from wherever they come.

Why this role?

As large language models progress, their ability to make use of new tools with little or no training will be key to proliferation of applications. Models that can interact with APIs give simple descriptions. Models that can navigate and interact with the web. Models that can effect change in the real world.

We are looking for candidates at all levels of experience, from new grads to experienced Machine Learning Engineers. This is a brand new team to Cohere, with an opportunity to have a direct impact on the next stage of our growth.

As a Machine Learning Engineer working on Tool Use, you will:
build and open-source software to train, deploy, and interface with models for tool use, built on Cohere's LLMs
improve the handling of long context in LLMs
collect human annotated data of tool use
build safety and personalisation mechanisms, allowing users to use their own API keys, logins, credit cards, etc securely
open agents up to Cohere community members for experimentation and feedback

You may be a good fit if:
You have used JAX/PyTorch before
You care about building robust tooling and infrastructure supporting applications of LLMs

If some of the above doesn’t line up perfectly with your experience, we still encourage you to apply! If you consider yourself a thoughtful worker, a lifelong learner, and a kind and playful team member, Cohere is the place for you.

We welcome applicants of all kinds and are committed to providing both an equal opportunity process and work environment. We value and celebrate diversity and strive to create an inclusive work environment for all.

The Cortex team is the core A.I. platform powering the vision of delivering the world’s best intelligent personal assistants to Walmart's customers, accessible via natural voice commands, text messages, rich UI interactions, and a mix of all of the above via multi-modal experiences.

We believe /conversations/ are a natural and powerful user interface for interacting with technology and enable a richer customer experiences -- both online and in-store. We are building and designing the next generation of Natural Language Understanding (NLU) services that other teams can easily integrate and leverage, and build rich experiences: from pure voice and text shopping assistants (Siri, Google Assistant, [[https://texttoshop.walmart.com/][Text to Shop]]), to customer care channels, to mobile apps with rich, intertwined, multi-modal interaction modes ([[https://apps.apple.com/us/app/me-walmart/id1459898418][Me@Walmart]]).

Interested in diving in?
We need solid engineers with the talent and expertise required to design, build, improve and evolve our capabilities in at least some of the following areas:
-Service oriented architecture in charge of exposing our NLU capabilities at scale, and enabling increasingly sophisticated model orchestration.
- Since the service takes in traffic for a large set of Walmart customers (that is 80% of American households!), you will get to solve non trivial challenges in terms of service scalability and availability.
- You will design and build the primitives to efficiently orchestrate model-serving microservices, taking into account their dependencies, and improving the /combined/ latency and robustness of such microservices (e.g. fan out in parallel to N services for a single request, and reply with whichever gives the fastest answer).
-You will also bake-in functionality which can drive improved machine learning modeling and experimental design, such as A/B testing. Model serving and operations
-There is a constant tension between model improvements (more computations) and model serving latency. So, we are always in a quest of crunching more numbers, while preserving our SLAs, and controlling the operational costs.
-You will guide our efforts to always find the best tradeoffs in terms of architecture, tooling (Tensorflow serving? / ONNYX? /Triton?) and infrastructure (CPU? / GPU?, GCP? / Azure?) for model serving -- based on the latest model developments and product requirements.
-In particular, you will drive principled and scientific load-testing efforts, to clearly identify the tradeoffs at hands, and tune/optimize the model-serving stack.
- Tooling, infrastructure and pipelines for reproducible workflow and models, enabling rapid innovation across the entire product lifecycle.
-You will author and maintain pipelines that safely build and deploy models to production via continuous deployment.
-You will achieve scalable and efficient resource management capabilities (cloud infrastructure).
- You will provide robust and built-in diagnostics for quality control throughout.
- You will integrate -- or build -- labeling tools which can seamlessly integrate at the heart of our conversation data store (GCP, BigQuery) and intertwine multiple labeling sources of various confidence levels.
-Come at the right time, and you will have an enormous opportunity to make a massive impact on the design, architecture, and implementation of an innovative, mission critical product, used every day, by people you know, and which customers love.
-As part of the emerging tech group, you will also have the additional opportunity of building demos, proof of concepts, creating white papers, writing blogs, etc.

As our new Software Developer, you will have the autonomy to choose projects and initiatives that interest and challenge you. This is a chance to continuously challenge yourself, absorb new information, and see the impact your technical work is making on the community and the healthcare industry.

Our roadmap currently includes the chance to:

Our digital healthcare solutions empower patients and physicians to overcome the barriers preventing the timely delivery of healthcare services. By replacing paper forms with digital tools we give patients and providers secure ways to connect, share health information, and update patient records. Our tools:

Empower patients to share health information with their physician before, during, and after visits, helping to ensure health records are up to date and accurate while improving patient care.
Meet the growing demand for virtual care solutions via an online booking system and secure messaging that brings significant benefits to patients while improving clinic efficiency and reducing the need for unnecessary phone calls.
Improve access to care by replacing faxes, calculating wait times, and reducing the time to process and access specialist referrals.

We are dedicated to our team, and we strongly believe that family comes first. To that end, we strive to find opportunities to support balance in the workplace and between work and home. As part of this, we have flexible hours, lunch socials (virtual for now but some physically-distanced small gatherings too), and meeting-free Friday afternoons.

About MakerSights

MakerSights is the only collaborative assortment management workspace that embeds consumer obsession directly into the concept-to-consumer process. The MakerSights Workspace enables retail brands to collect, analyze, and share the consumer data that teams need to make informed product and merchandising decisions from seasonal direction through go-to-market.

Historically, brands have accepted that about 40% of their products will go unsold and be sent to landfills or incineration as part of the cost of doing business. This is because they have not had access to objective consumer sentiment and demand data that helps them understand what their consumers will buy – and what they won't – when making critical assortment decisions. As a result, the industry has been forced to make inventory bets of close to $1 trillion each year.

At MakerSights, we envision a world where consumer obsession powers growth and sustainability. Our mission is to help brands create more products that people love so that collectively, we're able to radically reduce waste in the retail industry. Together, we will tackle the overproduction issue that plagues retail and is hurting our planet.

Our customers are consumer-obsessed, smart-to-market brands, including New Balance, Madewell, and Rothy's, that are radically reducing both economic and environmental waste, while driving profit margins that haven't been seen in decades.

Founded in 2015, MakerSights is headquartered in San Francisco with additional offices in Austin, Vancouver, and London. We are backed by some of the top technology and sustainability-focused investors, including Forerunner Ventures, Baseline Ventures, Gaingels, and G2 Venture Partners, a VC firm that exclusively invests in companies that are supporting sustainable innovations that help battle the climate crisis. We always try to be intentional about who we partner with, which is why we recently expanded our board representation to include Gaingels, an LGBTQ-focused investor syndicate that aligns with our commitment to fostering an inclusive company culture and supporting inclusive commerce.

At MakerSights, We get our energy from partnering with people who love what they do - both inside and outside of the office. We want you to know that we are committed to creating an environment where everyone can bring their true self to work everyday. As an equal opportunity employer, we prohibit any unlawful discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, military or veteran status, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability or genetic information.

Software Engineer (Startup),"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada",Beam Commerce,"About us

Beam Commerce builds next generation software to support independent eCommerce merchants on Shopify. Unlike major players such as Amazon, independent merchants don’t have robust technology powering their stores. The best eCommerce businesses use smart technology and provide great customer experiences. We want to help all merchants get there. To execute on this vision, we're making it easy for any business to setup and customize an incredible eCommerce experience using our apps. We've started with the building blocks that every merchant needs — product offers, store design, order tracking, etc. — and will over time create additional modules ourselves, integrate with other apps that merchants use, and open our API to collaborate with other developers so that we can serve businesses of all industries and sizes. Our apps so far are used by 7000+ brands and we're just getting started.

About the role

As a Software Engineer at Beam, you will be a critical part of our core team and have a huge influence over the direction of the company. You will work closely with the CTO and Product Team to lead engineering efforts. You will have the freedom to influence the product and technical operations and lead a team of talented engineers to do so. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your learning and development, and do everything we can to make sure this is the single best work experience of your life.

Who you are

You have good values. You have high integrity, strive for excellence, value respect (of others and yourself), and believe in the power of collaboration.
You have entrepreneurial drive. You are comfortable with uncertainty and high pace excites you. You may have worked at startups before or might want to build one yourself in the future.
You believe in hard work. You understand that the world's best companies are built by talented and hard working people.
You have experience. You have demonstrable experience working on production software and have worked across the stack. You have strong experience with full-stack development including React, Node.js, GraphQL, and MongoDB. Plus points if you have experience working with the Shopify development platform.
You know what the priority is. We don't care whether you have a CS degree from Harvard or learned it on YouTube. But, your work is important to us — and that your priority is to make progress.
You're a first principles thinker. You don't care about the complexities at the surface level of frontend/backend/etc. but are more interested in solving the core problem, holistically.
You're resourceful. You're going to run into problems that you don't know how to solve but you don't get stuck. If you don't understand something you quickly figure out what to do and move forward with a ""getting things done"" attitude.
You put customers first. You constantly put yourself in the shoes of our customers, thinking about the implications of what you're building. This reflects in your work — pushing deeply tested code, designing additional components, attention to detail, etc.
You love what you do. You enjoy every meeting, white-boarding experience, and line of code you write. You will do a lot of work, and you will have a lot of time to have fun. You enjoy this environment and love what you’re doing.

What you'll do

You'll ship. You'll be working on our core products to engineer solutions across multiple modules. You'll be moving fast no matter what you're building — new features, bug fixes, etc. You will see your work being used by real customers.
You'll be an owner. You'll be leading multiple products and be directly responsible for their success. You'll be collaborating with many stakeholders including the founders, designers, customers, and everyone else.
You'll balance the short and long term. While knowing the importance of shipping quickly you also know how to craft thoughtful long-term technical strategy. You know when to address tech debt and when to improve infrastructure and processes (testing, code reviews, etc.)
You'll help build the team. The first 10 members of a startup dictate the next 100. You'll help interview and recruit other talented engineers.
You'll learn about startups. Aside from your core work, you'll have the opportunity (if you’d like) to get involved in other areas - marketing, growth, ops, etc.

Competitive salary
Flexible working arrangements (we’re generally flexible as long as work gets done)

"Senior Data Scientist II, Machine Learning","Greater Toronto Area, Canada",SpotHero,"Data Scientists at SpotHero create data products fueled by machine learning under the hood. Over the course of your career at SpotHero, you will act in an end-to-end capacity to own and mature a portfolio of data science solutions. You will work across teams to understand needs, create data science solutions, advise stakeholders, and design advanced experiments to validate ideas and models.

As a Sr. Data Scientist II, you will be expected to carve out a portfolio of investigations and insights based on a broad need of ours. This will involve pairing with product managers and/or product designers to conduct discoveries to understand more about the domain stakeholder needs. You will then author problem statements with actionable hypotheses based on your discovery. After this, you will prototype solutions, work with stakeholders to test these prototypes, and improve / iterate on them as needed. If the acceptance criteria are met, you will then mature the solution into production working with our Machine Learning Engineers. Some examples of our broad themes include:

Pricing: Can we measure price elasticity by analyzing our historical data? Is it possible to measure price elasticity at a given parking facility? What factors influence price elasticity?
Personalization: How do drivers use our app and can we glean any insights about their buying preferences or parking intent? What opportunities are there to personalize the search experience? To what extent do price and distance alone explain why drivers choose one facility over another?
Business Operations: What is the cost of acquisition and lifetime value of our customers? How can we optimize marketing spend to reduce the cost of acquisition? What markets should we expand in?

In addition to focusing on one of these themes, you will be expected help with ad hoc requests that arise from stakeholders (such as advancing our dynamic pricing solution), provide constructive feedback on squad deliverables, and suggest how we can improve as a team. Everyone on the Data Science squad also invests 20% of our time proposing and investigating our own questions.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

Nous adoptons les technologies numériques et aidons nos clients à mettre en œuvre des changements au sein de leurs entreprises numériques. Certains nous pensent peut-être « vieux » (36 ans de réussites!) et axés seulement sur le matériel, mais nous sommes également une entreprise de logiciels Et une entreprise axée sur la sécurité. Une entreprise qui exploite les chaînes de blocs. Une entreprise qui exploite l’intelligence artificielle et l’apprentissage automatique. Nous avons même inventé un réseau intuitif qui s’adapte, prédit, apprend et protège. Aucune autre entreprise ne peut faire ce que nous faisons; nous ne pouvons pas être enfermés dans une seule case!

L’expression « transformation numérique » sert à attirer l’attention, mais elle est plutôt vide de sens si elle ne s’accompagne pas d’une culture qui autorise l’innovation, la créativité et, oui, même l’échec (si cela permet d’apprendre).

Au quotidien, nous nous concentrons sur l’offre et la demande. Nous donnons le meilleur de nous-mêmes, nous mettons notre ego de côté, et nous mettons du cœur au travail (cela fait partie de notre ADN). Nous prenons nos responsabilités, nous prenons des mesures audacieuses, et nous savons apprécier la différence.

Why Cisco

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Our data shows that Borrowell members reported up to a 100-point increase in their credit score after one year of using select Borrowell products.

With more than 2 million members, Borrowell is one of the largest fintech companies in Canada. We’re proud to have been named as one of the Best Workplaces in Canada every year since 2019, Globe and Mail’s Top Growing Companies (2021), LinkedIn’s Top 15 Startups in Canada (2021), and CB Insights’ Top 250 Fintechs (2021).

To support us on our mission, we’re building an exceptional team of high-performing yet humble individuals who believe Canadians deserve more choice when it comes to financial services.

Put simply, we put people first. We place a high value on building a diverse and inclusive workplace and are proud to have a gender-balanced team. We know that diverse teams perform better; half of our team identify as women or non-binary.

We’re always on the lookout for passionate and driven people. If you think you’d be a great fit at Borrowell, read on to learn more about us and how our business works!

About the Role:

As a Full Stack Developer on Borrowell’s Engineering team, you will design, develop, optimize, test, and maintain application code for in-house web and mobile products. You will ensure that software meets both the technical and business requirements that guided its design.

You will be involved in the technical roadmap of upcoming net new products and you will see how your hard work directly impacts the lives of 2 million people using the Borrowell marketplace. Specifically, maintenance of existing products will happen in any role, but this isn't one of those roles where the majority of your job is maintaining something that was already created. Instead, a large chunk of your time will be spent on working in cross-functional teams (with Product, Engineering, QA, Automation, and others) to experiment, explore, and build new products and functionalities from the ground up.

Requirements
Working experience building scalable web applications on the cloud, preferably in microservices architecture. Our back end is .NET 6 on Azure, but we are open to all technical backgrounds
Knowledge of modern JavaScript front-end frameworks. We primarily use modern Angular, Typescript, and ES6 with some React on our landing page
Demonstrated proficiency with SQL and NoSQL databases

Nice to Have
Knowledge of Microsoft Azure
Ability to write maintainable automated tests (we use Cypress and a Javascript-heavy automation suite)

We are persistent about solving problems we are facing
Change is good and welcomed
We are always willing to take on new challenges

We take ownership over our platform and the work that we deliver
We communicate clearly to ensure we collaborate well
We find the simplest solutions possible for the hardest problems

The Interview Process

We believe in fast, lean, and efficient processes and that trickles into every aspect of our work, including hiring. That means we don't think you need to jump through 8 hoops to land the role. Interviewing for this role is typically done in 3 steps:
A phone call with me, your technical recruiter
A technical coding challenge and discussion that is grounded in being practical, realistic, and open book - we're trying to understand your skills holistically, not trying to see how much you can memorize algorithms
A conversation with 1 senior leader and 1 non-technical colleague

That's it! After each step, I commit to getting you results within the same week.

Benefits
The Opportunity - join and have a major impact at a growing company that is helping make financial stability possible for everybody
Comprehensive Health Benefits - medical, dental, vision, and paramedical health benefits for you and your family, with extra yearly coverage for psychotherapists and massage therapists
Additional Health Benefits - virtual benefit offering that allows you to connect 24/7 with nurses, doctors and mental health professionals
Maternity & Parental Leave Top-up - available to new parents
Wellness Benefit - $600 annually to spend on whatever brings you joy

Employee Development Benefit - annual reimbursements on payments to help your learning
Givewell Benefit - 1 paid volunteer day a year to give back to the community
Flexibility - flexible working hours and a flexible vacation policy

We are remote-first across Canada, meaning you have no mandatory obligation to come in-office unless you choose to do so - you decide what is best for you. Our offices are located in Toronto, Kelowna, and Montreal, with teams distributed primarily in Ontario and BC.

At Borrowell, one of our core values and firm beliefs is that diversity makes us better. If you’re unsure about your qualifications for this position, we’d still encourage you to apply. We’re looking for candidates who have experience, but know that not everyone’s had a chance to demonstrate what they can do. What’s most important is that you have a growth mindset and care about helping people with their finances - an area in their lives that causes a lot of stress.

Please note that due to the sensitive nature of the work we do, clearing a credit and criminal record check is a condition of employment.

Borrowell encourages applications from candidates with differing abilities. Please let us know if you require accommodation at any stage in the selection process.

Software Engineer (Intern) Canada,"Nanaimo F, British Columbia, Canada",Cisco,"What You’ll Do

Our software engineers are the gurus behind the scenes, ensuring our programs are easy to use and bug free. Using a keen eye, you’ll develop software and tools in support of many of our high-impact technology platforms such as operating systems, networks, databases and more. While we’re growing in the software business, you’ll still need to see the big picture and watch for hardware compatibility while even potentially influencing design.

Unsure where to start? Apply and explore all of the possibilities in Applications Development, Database Development, Embedded Networking and OS Development, IT, Security, Test & Quality, Web Services, etc.

Who You’ll Work With

Our team of software gurus are busy programming magic across the globe on teams such as Engineering, Information Technology, Supply Chain, Customer Experience, Security and Trust, etc.

You would play a crucial role in driving next-gen software innovations including cloud, mobile, desktop or security spaces. On any of these teams, you'll get hands-on experience working with applications that make technology accessible no matter what device they’re on. See the possibilities when creativity meets design and build solutions which will transform how we work, live, learn, and play.

Who You Are
You are in excellent academic standing while currently enrolled in an accredited university pursuing a bachelor's or master's degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or a related major such as Math, Physics
You’re hungry to get your hands on new, exciting technologies and have a deep understanding of the fundamentals of computer science and engineering

#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

About Quora

The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people's heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet, yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds — from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences — so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it.

About The Team

Familiarity with theoretical foundations of statistical techniques (e.g. hypothesis testing, regression)
Demonstrated ability to exercise judgment and combine quantitative skills with intuition to translate numbers into insights
Demonstrated ability to clearly explain data results to cross-functional teams

Preferred Qualifications:

Experience evangelizing best practices and process improvements on your team
Experience working with large data sets and distributed computing tools (e.g. Presto, Redshift)

And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

"Python Developer, Forward Kitchens (Remote) - $60,000/year USD","Ontario, Canada",Crossover for Work,"Crossover is the world's #1 source of full-time remote jobs. Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?

On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.

That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts each, generate more online sales, and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.

In this role, you will play a major part in building our modern restaurant operating system, including delivery tablet aggregation, automated websites, online ordering, and much more. This is a fast-paced, high-impact work environment, so be prepared to move quickly and ship often. If you’re a Python developer with experience working in a fast-paced engineering culture and a keen eye for detail, then this role is for you!

What You Will Be Doing

Building the company's newest features; sample projects include Android applications that power kitchen operations and order deliveries, beautiful web applications with rich data visualizations, highly scalable cloud/serverless backend systems, and robust, scalable data pipelines

What You Won’t Be Doing

Working on minor bug fixes or features on outdated codebases
Dealing with tedious infrastructure to enable poorly written products to continue running
Managing people or getting stuck on long meetings discussing roadmaps and priorities

Basic Requirements

Python Developer key responsibilities

At least 3 years of experience coding with Python
Professional experience using EC2 and AWS Lambda

Job Description

Twitter is seeking a Staff Backend Software Engineer, Machine Learning for Birdwatch, our pilot program in a new crowdsourced/participatory approach to reducing misleading information. Birdwatch pushes the state-of-the-art in approaching misleading information on the Internet and we employ a deeply experimental, fast-moving, and iterative approach to find product solutions that work for customers.

We are looking for someone who can work across backend and machine learning systems — designing, developing and launching services that power core features of Birdwatch, efficient and reliable data pipelines, and production machine learning systems. You need not have equal experience across backend, data pipelines, and ML systems — if you have significant experience in one area, and some experience (or interest) in the others, that can work.

You’ll work as part of a cross-functional team including machine learning, engineering, data science, research, design, product, and even academic experts outside the company who study the space.

What You’ll Do

As we bring Birdwatch to the world, you will play a critical role in scaling and launching the core algorithms, data pipelines and backend services that power Birdwatch in real-time, including
Compute contributor helpfulness scores that are resistant to adversaries and bad actors, e.g. using iterative graph propagation algorithms in a similar style as PageRank, or explicit coordinated manipulation/spam detection
Detect rater similarity/diversity and polarization, using techniques such as matrix factorization to learn user embeddings or similarities
Develop and operate real-time data pipelines in support of the note scoring and reputation algorithms that power Birdwatch
Design elements of our backend architecture. Focus on enabling rapid iteration to validate product hypotheses, and ensuring a plan for broader, scalable designs if hypotheses are validated
Build and design novel user-facing product experiences
Partner with client teams to define APIs, and potentially even assist in building client code and product experiences
Drive communication and coordination with partner teams (from Health to Legal to Core Services to API, etc).
Open-sourcing as much of our core algorithmic code as possible, in the spirit of Birdwatch’s transparency
Qualifications
B.S., M.S., and/or PhD in Computer Science or a related technical field, or equivalent experience
5+ years of experience in backend systems or distributed systems/large scale data processing
Experience and familiarity with the modern data pipeline and ML infrastructure ecosystem
Great understanding of one or more of the following Scala, C++, or Java
Bonus Qualifications (but Not Necessary)
Experience owning a production machine learning system and/or pipeline
Basic familiarity with statistics and machine learning, especially in relevant domains e.g. graph algorithms, matrix factorization, using human-in-the-loop data, bad actor/manipulation modeling, game theory, interpretable and fair ML, active learning, etc.
Proficiency with Python and SQL
Who You Are
You’ve built and maintained a large-scale distributed system and/or machine learning data pipeline
Passion for the problem of misleading information & creating a better informed world
Enjoy a rapid iterative approach / the 0-to-1 experience
Enioy working in an ambiguous space with no known product solutions, and trailblazing to build novel solutions that work
Ability to move fast and get things done, and help the broader team do so (to enable rapid iteration on the product)
Comfortable (maybe even excited) to work with a distributed team
You are experienced with software engineering best practices and bring a disciplined approach to testing and driving reductions in technical debt

Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, Forward Kitchens. Have you got what it takes?

On-demand food delivery is the future of restaurants. However, most restaurants are either ill-equipped or unaware of how to unlock their full delivery revenue potential through digitization. A restaurant’s digital presence could be the difference between a viral hit like Salt Bae’s booming global steak empire (which is just ok, if you ask us) and your favorite mom-and-pop hole-in-the-wall that went out of business during the pandemic.

That’s where Forward Kitchens comes in. We empower restaurants to create multiple digital storefronts each, generate more online sales, and increase their bottom line – all without having to hire a creative marketing team or deal with the millions (we’re exaggerating) of delivery platforms out there. We believe in our partner restaurants’ power to represent their communities and provide delicious, eclectic meals to their ever-ravenous customers at scale.

In this role, you will play a major part in building our modern restaurant operating system, including delivery tablet aggregation, automated websites, online ordering, and much more. This is a fast-paced, high-impact work environment, so be prepared to move quickly and ship often. If you’re a Python developer with experience working in a fast-paced engineering culture and a keen eye for detail, then this role is for you!

What You Will Be Doing

Scraping data from third parties
Developing new backend features, like API endpoints, job queues, and data acquisition platforms
Building resilient data strategies for structured and unstructured data

What You Won’t Be Doing

Working on minor bug fixes or features on outdated codebases
Dealing with tedious infrastructure to enable poorly written products to continue running
Managing people or getting stuck on long meetings discussing roadmaps and priorities

Basic Requirements

Full Stack Engineer,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",Citylitics Inc.,"About Citylitics

What is Infrastructure? It is the roadways you rely on to safely get to Grandma's house, it's the potable water that comes out of your kitchen tap that you wash your family's food with and it's the energy that heats our homes and powers our digital lifestyles.

Every year, trillions of dollars are spent on all areas of infrastructure to maintain our quality life and move our economy forward. However, our infrastructure is no longer equipped to meet the needs of the future. We hear about infrastructure failures, whether bridge collapses, power blackouts, or water main breaks, every day in the news. Climate change and extreme weather events are disrupting the basic infrastructure we took for granted for years.

Citylitics is solving the hardest data problems in infrastructure while building the market & opportunity intelligence platform that enables a faster, more transparent, and more efficient infrastructure marketplace. We turn millions of unstructured documents into high value intelligence feeds and datasets that are available on an intuitive user experience. Our goal is to enable solution providers to connect with cities with relevant infrastructure needs in a faster and more digital way than historic market channels. As more companies adopt our platform, cities & utilities will be able to access solutions that deliver on the promise of moving towards a more resilient, sustainable, and equitable infrastructure future.

Who Are We Looking For?

We are looking for a product-centric Full Stack Developer who enjoys building both frontends and backends, and has prior exposure to large-scale cloud web services. Reporting to our Software Team Manager and working closely with Product Managers and peer developers, you will play an instrumental role in executing on our ambitious Product Roadmap.

We have developed the largest and fastest growing data platform on North American infrastructure with over 1 Billion public documents from over 31,000 cities and utilities in the US & Canada, triangulated with dozens of government data sources, and refreshed every two weeks. We are now quickly expanding into new industries ranging from public transportation, roads and highways, power, gas, healthcare, waste management, and more. You will make a major impact on the success of our platform as we expand rapidly and unlock new use cases for our users.

Our ideal candidate brings a “do what needs to be done” attitude, has a strong sense of ownership, and thrives in a fast-paced development environment. We expect you to be collaborative, solutions-oriented, and a key contributor to our Sprint Planning and Backlog prioritization. You will have gone through at least one end-to-end product development cycle with an aptitude for bringing intuitive user experiences to life. This is an excellent opportunity for someone looking to take the next step in their career at a purpose-focused, fast-growing start-up.

Most of our team is based out of Toronto but we are working remotely due to COVID-19. We are open to fully remote candidates but have a preference for candidates based in Toronto, Kitchener/Waterloo, Milwaukee, Chicago, or Austin. We have offices in Toronto, Milwaukee, and Austin.

What Will You Accomplish?
Work closely with a cross-functional team including product managers, developers, client success managers, and intelligence analysts to understand user needs requirements from our data infrastructure and develop solutions to improve product delivery and end-user experience.
Execute on our Product Roadmap by building & implementing new features and developing solutions to our most pressing technical and user challenges
Design, implement, build and maintain our large and distributed, high availability microservices, internal tools, user interfaces, and deployment systems
Live Outside The Box: You are empowered by Team Leaders to seek out and adapt the latest software technologies to develop the functionality that will improve our user experience and product quality.
The impact you will make extends beyond just the success of our platform but the improvement of the world's public infrastructure

Onboarding Plan
Within 7 days: Familiarize yourself with the team, workflow, and deploy the containerized local development environment to your machine
Within 30 days: See features through from conceptualization to deployment while maintaining a high standard of quality
Within 90 days: Understand our internal and external users and develop a voice to advocate for them during Product and Development planning, review existing standards and suggests improvements and changes, shape the direction of our application

Our Tech Stack
Frontend: Javascript (React, Redux, Material-UI, and Styled Components) comprise our main Single Page Application
Backend: A Python Django Application serves our frontend and APIs. A Kubernetes cluster for our data ingestion and processing which feeds a MySQL database and an Elasticsearch cluster.
Infrastructure: We deploy a number of Docker containers to the Google Cloud Platform and use various services like Cloud Vision, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Pub/Sub. Our deployments are coordinated with Cloud Build. Logs are maintained via Kibana.

Requirements
At least 2 years of production quality code at scale
Degree in a Computer Science / Software Engineering field or equivalent practical experience.
You’re evidence-driven and data-driven. You make decisions because they have shown to be effective and they cater to the people you’re developing for.
Be comfortable in a quickly changing environment, with a small team and a lot of responsibility.
A passion for quality, an obsession with automation and a love for writing clean, effective code + documentation.
A drive to be involved in the entire development cycle, from planning through monitoring in production.
While a familiarity with some or all of the above tools and framework is a bonus, previous experience is not required. A familiarity with the underlying principles of agile software development in a production environment would be the key focus.
An understanding of effective testing strategies and how to develop automated integration and deployment pipelines

Benefits

Why Citylitics?
This is a rare opportunity to influence positive change within one of the biggest societal challenges of our generation (infrastructure - from water to transport to energy and more).

As a result, we are often posed with interesting and challenging engineering problems, which will encourage you to prototype, iterate, and innovate. It's part of the company culture to encourage crazy ideas, and celebrate failures as learning opportunities. Many of the design problems you will encounter won't have answers on Google or Stack Overflow, they will encourage you to come up with unique approaches and strengthen your design thinking
Growth: Working at a start-up is a great way to supercharge your skillset, and accelerate your learning.

As a Senior Research Data Scientist, you will report to the Data Science Manager/Lead and will collaborate with the team to form hypotheses and conduct experiments to iterate over the creation of highly crafted predictive variables, model training, validation of results and conversion of predictions into an efficient solution for the business problem at hand. Your knowledge and experience allow you to work efficiently from the early, and highly challenging, stages of the experimentation to produce insights that allow for smarter experiments subsequently.

You will have the opportunity to work in an industry where creating pioneering solutions to address business challenges will be a part of your daily routine. In our ever-evolving industry, every project requires a collaborative and customized approach that can be transparently validated through extensive exploratory data analysis techniques and easily explained to technical and non-technical stakeholders. Therefore, if you’re someone who likes to roll up their sleeves and do the work than needs to be done, who is a good communicator, an enthusiastic team player, who likes to think outside the box and embraces a good challenge this position is for you.

Qualifications

PhD degree in a STEM field, and 5 years of research experience with using advanced statistical methods and machine learning algorithms to solve problems.

During each iteration you will spend about 5% of the time training models and 95% of the time on the other steps.
Many of the problems we solve require the creation of customized validation methods to be able to understand and quantify how, and whether, the predictions help solve the business problem at hand. You will spend a significant amount of time creating and using customized validation methods.
Iterate quickly by taking decisions based on results to validate/adjust the course of action for the subsequent analysis steps.
We work with data that presents us with multiple interesting challenges and interesting problems. You will maintain a strong focus on the work priority to solve the problem at hand.

Step up from an Intermediate role to a Senior Software Developer opportunity at a healthtech scaleup. This is a chance to continuously challenge yourself, absorb new information, and see the impact your technical work is making on the community and the healthcare industry.

As our new Senior Software Developer, you will have the autonomy to choose projects and initiatives that interest and challenge you. Our roadmap currently includes the chance to:

Our digital healthcare solutions empower patients and physicians to overcome the barriers preventing the timely delivery of healthcare services.

Empower patients to share health information with their physician before, during, and after visits, helping to ensure health records are up to date and accurate while improving patient care.
Meet the growing demand for virtual care solutions via an online booking system and secure messaging that brings significant benefits to patients while improving clinic efficiency and reducing the need for unnecessary phone calls.
