      "At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing.

The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it.

The MakerSights Workspace enables retail brands to collect, analyze, and share the consumer data that teams need to make informed product and merchandising decisions from seasonal direction through go-to-market.\n",
      "\n",
      "Historically, brands have accepted that about 40% of their products will go unsold and be sent to landfills or incineration as part of the cost of doing business. This is because they have not had access to objective consumer sentiment and demand data that helps them understand what their consumers will buy – and what they won't – when making critical assortment decisions. As a result, the industry has been forced to make inventory bets of close to $1 trillion each year.\n",

      "At MakerSights, we envision a world where consumer obsession powers growth and sustainability. Our mission is to help brands create more products that people love so that collectively, we're able to radically reduce waste in the retail industry. Together, we will tackle the overproduction issue that plagues retail and is hurting our planet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our customers are consumer-obsessed, smart-to-market brands, including New Balance, Madewell, and Rothy's, that are radically reducing both economic and environmental waste, while driving profit margins that haven't been seen in decades.\n",

We are backed by some of the top technology and sustainability-focused investors, including Forerunner Ventures, Baseline Ventures, Gaingels, and G2 Venture Partners, a VC firm that exclusively invests in companies that are supporting sustainable innovations that help battle the climate crisis. We always try to be intentional about who we partner with, which is why we recently expanded our board representation to include Gaingels, an LGBTQ-focused investor syndicate that aligns with our commitment to fostering an inclusive company culture and supporting inclusive commerce.\n",
