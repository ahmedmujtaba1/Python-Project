      "At Myant, we are creating the world’s first expressive and continuous digital presence platform, enabled by integrating technology directly into clothing and augmented by other devices, wearables, and IOT. We see the evolution of society where every member gets to participate from anywhere and anytime through a whole-body experience, mostly in a passive or ambient manner to foster ubiquitous accessibility. Humans have a fundamental desire and need to be connected to our environment, family, community and technology. This level of connection will create a paradigm shift in the way we deal with each other, especially from afar, allowing for more meaningful relationships, and more in-depth representation of ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "The need for this type of connection is not new. There are many companies working on ways to connect humans in singularity with technology, however most of these technologies are based on devices that are often used in episodical ways hence, leading to poor adoption or reliability. In general, innovation and technology have delivered significant benefits for many members of society however, there are those who are left behind, namely the very young, the marginalized, the old and the sick. The challenge of inclusion for those left behind requires us to move beyond device focused strategies, towards an interface that we use naturally, every day. We believe that textile is that primary interface, used in clothing, coverings, carpeting and more, we wear and are surrounded by textiles universally, at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such an interface could fuse data with other devices that we use periodically and data with other IoTs in the environment. People could then leverage their physical presence over their digital presence to communicate and share personal wellbeing. This could unlock healthcare that is proactive and preventative, social connectedness that is more profound, enable care distribution models to be seamless and on demand, better fitness insights, safer working environments and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The vision for SKIIN -our first consumer-facing brand- is to enhance human ability through connected clothing and textiles. Skiin is in beta-phase market launch and has been recently granted Health Canada medical device license and submitted to FDA for regulatory approval in the US market. The sensors and actuators embedded within our apparel create your Digital Identity, which will be consumed by those who matter to you - your family members, physicians, trainers, other IoT devices - without you consciously having to think about it. The line between the digital and physical world is becoming increasingly blurry and we believe textile is the next medium to bridge that gap.\n",

      "Drug repositioning is the process of identifying novel therapeutic potentials for existing drugs and discovering therapies for untreated diseases. Since drug repositioning relies on data for existing drugs and disease, the enormous growth of publicly available large-scale biological, biomedical and electronic health-related data along with MI/AI have accelerated the development of computational drug repositioning approaches. Biomedical communities have performed and analyzed various types of high-throughput experiments to understand physiological, biochemical and genetic relationships in the human body system. Furthermore, over 20 millions of biomedical research articles have been examined for the understanding of how chemicals, genes and physiological phenotypes interact with each other using Natural Language Processing techniques. However, regardless of these efforts, integrating multiple biochemical relationships and text mining information for drug repositioning is still a major challenge.\n",
      "Klick will develop a new method to find novel repositioning drugs by integrating heterogeneous biomedical networks and text mining. To do this, network propagation, graph neural networks or other ML/DL algorithms will be applied to find novel associations between diseases and existing drugs. Klick collected various drug-related data, such as chemical properties, therapeutic characteristics, targets and physiological effects of approved drugs as well as over 20 years of accumulation of drug-related research articles. Intern will extract biomedical relationships from Klick’s drug datalake, and build a predictive model to find novel drug-disease interactions.\n",
